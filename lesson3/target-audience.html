<h3>Personas</h3>
<p>Hunter Smith. He is 19 years-old and an avid snowboarder that hits the slopes at least 5 times a week during winter and works part time down in a gift shop in Park City. Fake snow
 made by the ski resorts is not his favorite, he wants fresh powder and the only way to know that is if the weather forecast shows heavy snow. He is the Age
 where it is commonplace to have a phone stuck to your hand, and he uses it often to record himself going down the double diamonds.</p>

 <p>Laurie Williams. She is a 40 year=old real estate agent that has contacts up and down the state of Utah. Driving 4 hours
     down to St. George to show a house is all in a days work. She needs to be able to know the weather and how it will affect her ability to 
     drive to appointments. She is proficient with all technology seeing as she lists many properties on the internet, and communicated with many clients
     vis email and Zoom meetings. </p>
